<h1>4.1 Representations of Graphs</h1>
<p>
  In the previous chapter, we represented graphs with diagrams, such as sketching the graph 
  as in example 3.1. However, when tasked with more complex analysis and operations on graphs, 
  this approach is not efficient. We need a more formal and effective representation method for graphs.
</p>
<h2>4.1.1 Adjacency Matrix</h2>
<p>
  One of the ways to represent graphs is to describe the graph using its adjacency matrix.
</p>
<h3>Definition 4.1.1 â€” Adjacency Matrix of a Graph</h3>
<p>
  Let G be a graph with a set of vertices V, where the size of V is |V| = n. The adjacency matrix of the graph G
  will be an n x n matrix, where the rows and columns correspond to the vertices of graph G in some arbitrary, 
  but fixed, order. The element a<sub>ij</sub> of the adjacency matrix, at row i and column j, 
  indicates the number of edges connecting vertices i and j in graph G.
</p>
<h3>Example 4.1</h3>
<p>
  Consider graph G, which we see in the diagram to the right. Graph G has 3 vertices, 
  therefore the adjacency matrix of graph G will have dimensions 3 x 3. Let us not specify any particular 
  order of vertices, for example, lexicographical. The rows and columns of the matrix will correspond to the 
  vertices of graph G in any chosen order.

  As each loop at vertex i is counted twice, if i = j, then each loop includes vertex i twice.
